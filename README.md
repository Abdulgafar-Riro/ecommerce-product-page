## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Navigate product images using next and previous buttons
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **SCSS** (with mixins and variables)
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) â€“ JS library for UI
- React **hooks** (`useState`) for state management

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my React and SCSS workflow.

Some key takeaways:

1. Managing state with `useState` to handle cart updates and image navigation.
2. Building a **lightbox modal** with thumbnails, next/previous navigation, and an overlay.
3. Styling hover and active states for thumbnails using SCSS pseudo-elements.

Example: **thumbnail hover and active states**

```scss
.thumbnail:hover::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}

.active-thumb {
  border: 2px solid $Orange;

  &::after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);
  }
}
```

Example: **using `useState` for image navigation**

```jsx
const [currentImage, setCurrentImage] = useState(0);

const handleNextImage = () => {
  setCurrentImage((prev) => (prev === productImages.length - 1 ? 0 : prev + 1));
};

const handlePrevImage = () => {
  setCurrentImage((prev) => (prev === 0 ? productImages.length - 1 : prev - 1));
};
```

### Continued development

- Improve **accessibility** (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes for modal/lightbox).
- Add **animations** for image transitions in the lightbox.
- Explore **global state management** (e.g., React Context) for cart instead of prop drilling.
- Convert styles into **CSS Modules** or **Styled Components** for better component encapsulation.

### Useful resources

- [React Docs â€“ useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) â€“ Helpful for managing state.
- [CSS Tricks â€“ Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) â€“ Quick reference for layouts.
- [MDN â€“ position: fixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) â€“ Useful when creating the lightbox modal.
